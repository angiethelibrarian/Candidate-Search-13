## Description

This Candidate Search Application allows employers to review potential candidates and save their profiles to a list of potential hires. Employers can view candidate details like name, username, location, avatar, email, company, and GitHub profile URL. Users can save or skip candidates, and the app ensures data persistence across sessions.

## Installation

- npm install
- npm run start

## Usage

From the candidate search page, the user can view, save (using + button), or skip (using the - button) information for one candidate.
No More Candidates: When all candidates are reviewed, the app will display a message indicating no candidates are available.
From the potential candidates view the list of saved candidates, including all their information.
